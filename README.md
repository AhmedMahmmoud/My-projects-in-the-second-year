# Welcome! In this repository you will find some projects that were assigned to me during my second year of study. These projects include working with arrays and performing various operations on them, and some projects that were also asked of me in the operating systems class, which are great for jogging your memory. I hope you find these projects useful and informative, God willing. Feel free to explore the warehouse and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments. Thank you for stopping by!
